## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project demonstrates **data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and dashboard creation in Excel**.  
It can be showcased as both a **Data Analyst** and an **MIS Executive** project.

Dataset: Bike Buyers Dataset

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicate records  
   - Standardized categorical columns:
     - `M` â†’ Married, `S` â†’ Single
     - `M` â†’ Male, `F` â†’ Female
   - Created `Age Group` column using IF conditions:
     - Young (<30)
     - Middle-aged (30â€“49)
     - Senior (50+)
   - **Corrected Income column** to ensure proper numeric formatting  
   - **Corrected Commute Distance column** by merging inconsistent categories:  
     - e.g., `10+ Miles` and `More than 10 Miles` â†’ `10+ Miles`

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Built Pivot Tables to summarize:
     - Bike purchase by marital status
     - Bike purchase by gender
     - Bike purchase by region & age group
     - Bike purchase by commute distance and income
     - 
3. **Dashboard**
   - Created an interactive dashboard in Excel with Pivot Charts
   - Visualized relationships between income, age, region, commute distance, and bike purchasing behavior

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Married individuals showed higher bike purchase rates compared to singles.  
- Higher income groups are more likely to purchase bikes.  
- The Pacific region had stronger bike purchase trends.  
- Middle-aged individuals (30â€“49) represent the largest bike buyer segment.  
- Shorter commute distances (0â€“5 miles) were associated with more bike purchases compared to long commutes.
